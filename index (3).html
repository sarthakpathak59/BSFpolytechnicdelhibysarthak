      <i><b><font size="5%"><FONT COLOR="#008080"></strong>Dear Students,<br>
I am extremely happy to welcome you to BSF Polytechnic  started with an objective to provide quality education and excellence in ever changing field of technical education. Technology is advancing day by day. It has made education more effective and interesting today. The maxim &#8220;survival of fittest&#8221; is more relevant now than ever before. We believe in value based quality education and faculty members at BSF Polytechnic are striving hard for it, so that alumni of BSF Polytechnic is well received by the Industry, public and private sector organization and others. 
In recent years diploma in the technical education has become the foremost academic qualification for all leading industries.   Now a days diploma is required in meeting challenges of the rapidly changing technical environment.
India produces the largest number of diploma holders, more than a million, taking into account government and private technical institutions. However, when it comes to employment, a very low percent is actually considered &#8216;employable&#8217; by Indian and Multi-national companies. One of the major reasons is that most of the colleges do not go beyond the curriculum to teach essential &#8216;soft skills&#8217; such as the ability to analyze, innovate and communicate but we prefer such type of  technical education enhanced with "soft skills".
I expect our students to be sincere, responsible and committed to their work. I wish Best of Luck to all the students in their endeavours.
