    		<p> here is a saying that teachers are greater than the parents. Parents give birth to a child whereas teachers mould that child's personality and provide a bright future. Apart from academics, teachers stand by us at every step to guide, motivate and inspire to become better people</p>

    		<p> I have seen you all laugh and cry. I’ve seen you be hyper organized and feel completely lost. And I’ve seen some of you have breakthroughs about your future while others start to question everything. Getting to watch you grow and learn and plan and succeed is what I love most about working with students. Like listening to one student profess their love for dance and then seeing that passion play out at almost every school event. Or seeing another student grin with a sense of accomplishment as they shared with me the responses of those who were so thankful to have the new spiritual center dome. Or listening to a student humbly share about their efforts over the summer to provide some relief to victims of last year’s earthquake in Nepal. Or those of you who share entirely too much gossip with me (you know who you are). Or sitting in awe as I listened to the thoughtful and mature reflections of my Service Week group after several hot and emotionally exhausting days volunteering at a girls home in Panama. These are but a few examples of the conversations and experiences that I will remember most.</p>
